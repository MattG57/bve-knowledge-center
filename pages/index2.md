## Purpose

In order to provide an organized place to learn all about Business Value Engineering, we wanted to create a GitHub Repository and GitHub Pages site 
to make it easy to more easily Create, Find, and Collaborate on informational assets related to Business Value Engineering.

Hopefully you will find the Site "Intuitive" and a good reference for anyone wanting to leverage the Methodology of Business Value Engineering in their work at GitHub and Beyond!

(Note: This site is intended to be Public and accessible to Customers. Therefore All Content Has been Scrubbed of Customer Names and any other identifying or confidential information!)

## Features

What are the features that this Pages/Jekyll/GitHub structure provides? 
You should see the {% include doc.html name="Getting Started" path="getting-started" %}
guide for a complete summary. Briefly:

 - *Simplified User interaction* including consistent permalinks, links to ask questions via GitHub issues, and edit the file on GitHub directly.
 - *Integrated Search* across posts, documentation, and other site pages, with an ability to exclude from search.
 - *External Search* meaning an ability to link any page tag to trigger an external search.
 - *Documentation* A documentation collection that was easy to organize on the filesystem, render with nested headings for the user, and refer to in markdown.
 - *Pages* A separate folder for more traditional pages (e.g, about).
 - *Navigation*: Control over the main navigation on the left of the page, and automatic generation of table of contents for each page on the right.
 - *News* A posts feed for news and updates, along with an archive (organized by year).
 - *Templates* or specifically, "includes" that make it easy to create an alert, documentation link, or other content.
 - *Continuous Integration via GH Pages* to auto-render the site when anything Changes!
